# Tyrian

Tyrian is an Elm-inspired frontend framework for Scala.js.

Primarily designed for building SPAs (Single Page Applications) for web and mobile, it combines all the life-cycle reason-ability of Elm, with a less opinionated style that allows full JS interoperability, all your favorite FP tropes, and the asynchronous (side) Effect handling Scala is famous for.

We can't wait to see what you build with it!
