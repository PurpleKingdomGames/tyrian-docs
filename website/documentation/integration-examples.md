# Integration-Examples

The 'feature examples' available on this website try to cover how to use Tyrian, but not the various ways that it can be setup and integrated with different build tools, services, networking protocols, and css frameworks.

Some examples of those kinds of integrations can be found in the [integrated-examples](https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/tyrian-docs/tree/main/integrated-examples) folder of the tyrian-docs repo.

> Note: The networking examples are duplicated in both example areas. In the feature examples they compile and are viewable, but may not work. In the integrated examples, if run correctly, they should work.
